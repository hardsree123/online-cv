      Below is a list of open source side projects i have done also the projects i have done as part of my .
    assignments:
      - title: OPV (Optimized Pickup Values for Container Waste Management) 
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "The project involves multiple services working as a single module. Web API to handle incoming GET and POST requests for data. 
        GET and POST requests for data. All services intercommunicate via AMQP (RabbitMQ). 
        Distance and travel time calculated by the route planner involving Dijkstras algorithm with several factors inplace. 
        The calculated distance and travel time OD Matrix is fed to a route optimizer library that generates an optimized list of pickup sequence for the waste locations"
      - title: Route planner divider restriction upgrade
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Existing route planner was upgraded to obey divider restrictions for right side driving. 
        The upgrade involved adding additional restriction information to the binary input file. 
        This was calculated based on the navteq streets divider classification. The method involved identifying navigable left turns from a divider 
        road using mathematical calculations. The left turns that aren’t navigable were marked as restrictions in the binary input file"
      - title: Mail SOAP XML based Special transport planner
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Mail Based special transport planner is a multi-threaded windows service that is configured with Imap and SMTP settings. 
        It downloads movement requests received from users who share the filled in movement form via mail, 
        this is processed and a response with a future reference is shared with the user. In addition the planner does document validations to provide
        valid response to the user for rejecting his movement request. The moderator on the other end receives the movement request he is
        greeted with the general details relevant for him to accept or reject the movement, he can edit and replan the movement’s traversing route 
        using the openlayers based map ui. SOAP Xml based special transport planner is a WCF application built using the same library but handles the 
        movement requests via SOAP UI, the request is sent as a xml request which is processed and validated by the SOAP Xml receiver. The entire project is built as 
        an upgrade to already existing special transport planner"
      - title: E-Ink Based display software upgrade
        link: "#"
        tagline: "The project involved upgrading the DRIS modules configured for Bus stops to handle the newly incorporated E-Ink displays. 
        The display receives png image and stores it in its memory and displays the same during the configured time period. 
        The display communicates with the C# based application over GPRS. The images are uploaded via a asp.net based back office application for a specific display, 
        this is picked up by the C# based windows service that forwards the image in binary format along with other relevant data. 
        The display is programmed to receive the image and send acknowledgement."
      - title: DRIS
        link: "#"
        tagline: "DRIS is a dynamic bus station project that handles platform reservations and allocation to incoming buses in real time. 
        Different modules of dris communicate over TCP/IP. The allocation of platforms to buses are shown on displays as information to passengers. 
        The allocation algorithm takes into account all future incoming buses, inaccessible platforms, occupied platforms and so on."
      - title: Special transport planner (Structure maintenance tool)
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Structure data in STP system needs to be periodically updated based on the updates
        received from the structure owners. It is a web based portal in which all the structure
        maintenance related functionalities are catered. There are four stages through which the
        structures are updated in the cleansing tool; verifying the structures received from the
        structure owners, cleansing the receiving data, comparing it with the original structure from
        STP system and cleansing it and finally publishing the cleansed data to Staging and
        Production. This portal is exclusively developed from the helpdesk and no other users have
        privilege to access."   
      - title: STP-Special Transport planner
        link: "#"
        tagline: "STP is a system that simplifies the process of notifying abnormal load movements.
        Legislation requires that vehicles and load movements that exceed standard dimensions
        need to be pre-notified to police, highway and bridge authorities. Advance route planning is
        a major functionality that helps the haulier users to plan the routes through which their
        movements have to go."
